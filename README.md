## 📖 About The Project

**Delver** is an emotionally intelligent curation engine designed to ground you, lift you, and then let you float. It doesn't just shuffle songs; it builds a bridge between emotional states.

The generated playlist, **"Antigravity – Sakeena"**, is not random. It is engineered with a mandatory "Antigravity Curve" that transitions the listener through four distinct phases of regulations.

## 🌊 The Antigravity Curve

| Phase | Zone | Emotional Intent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Grounding** 🧱 | Deep safety, spiritual roots, and heavy grounding.<br>*(e.g., Quranic recitations, Nasheeds)* |
| **II** | **Gentle Lift** 💧 | Water textures, piano, and clarity.<br>*(e.g., Joe Hisaishi, Yiruma)* |
| **III** | **Float State** ☁️ | Weightless lofi, "antigravity", and airy dreams.<br>*(e.g., Jinsang, Nujabes)* |
| **IV** | **Soft Landing** 🕊️ | Gratitude, silence, and peace.<br>*(e.g., Arvo Pärt, Maher Zain)* |
